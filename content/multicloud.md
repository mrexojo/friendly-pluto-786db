      Define a Multicloud strategy does not necessarily mean that you are going
      to change cloud providers. Designing a multicloud strategy adapted to the
      project or company allows us to be prepared for future problems of the
      cloud provider, our economic situation or new lines of business.

      You know that replicating the entire infrastructure would increase your
      bill if you maintain it over time,  that is why most clients choose to
      choose the most **critical parts**, or to **repeat this process as a
      disaster recovery strategy over time** to test certain parts of their
      infrastructure in other alternatives.

      ###### Availability Service


      ###### Compute process
