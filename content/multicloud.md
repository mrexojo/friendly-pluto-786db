      provider?


      Because defining a Multicloud strategy does not necessarily mean that you
      are going to change cloud providers. Designing a multicloud strategy
      adapted to the project or company allows us to be prepared for future
      problems of the cloud provider, our economic situation or new lines of
      business.

      behave in other cloud providers.


      You know that replicating the entire infrastructure would increase your
      bill if you maintain it over time,  that is why most clients choose to

      strategy over time** to test certain parts of their infrastructure in
      other alternatives
