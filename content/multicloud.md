      Because defining a Multicloud strategy does not necessarily mean that you
      are going to change cloud providers. Designing a multicloud strategy

      problems of the cloud provider, our economic situation or new lines of
      business.

      You know that replicating the entire infrastructure would increase your
      bill if you maintain it over time,  that is why most clients choose to

      strategy over time** to test certain parts of their infrastructure in
      other alternatives
