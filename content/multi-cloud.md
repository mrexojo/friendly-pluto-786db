Thanks to iaac, you have the key to analyze how your services or product behave in other cloud providers. You know that replicating the entire infrastructure would increase your bill if you maintain it over time, that is why most clients choose to choose the most critical parts, or to r**epeat a disaster recovery strategy over time** to test certain parts of their infrastructure in other alternatives.

##### Why should I try other options if I am happy with my current cloud provider?

Because defining a Multicloud strategy does not necessarily mean that you are going to change cloud providers. Designing a multicloud strategy adapted to the project or company allows us to be prepared for future problems of the cloud provider, our economic situation or new lines of business.
